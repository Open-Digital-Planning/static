  <p>The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) is funding 
    English councils to collaboratively develop digital planning services as 
    part of the commitment to improve the planning system outlined in the 
    <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3155">Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill</a>, 
    and aspirations for the future of local government services expressed in the 
   <a href="https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/what-is-the-declaration/">Local Digital Declaration</a>.</p>

    content: |
      <p>Currently, councils can only adopt our services by applying for 
        funding from DLUHC to join the Open Digital Planning project team. 
        Council officers are expected to contribute their time to the project 
        alongside adopting the services, which are still in development. 
        This helps us to keep a tight focus on user needs when designing the services.</p>
      <p>DLUHC's funding round for planning software is currently open in November 2022, 
        and will close on 23 December 2022. Councils looking to apply to join Open 
        Digital Planning should read <a href="/join">how to join</a> to better 
        understand what involvement in the project looks like.</p>
      <p>To apply for funding and find out more about the support available, read 
        more about the <a href="https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/digital-planning/digital-planning-software/funding/">Planning Software Improvement Fund on DLUHC's Local Digital website</a>.</p>
